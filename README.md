## Repository files

Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body PBPK model of  Sufentanil, that has been developed using clinical studies in adults and evaluated for its predictive performance of CYP3A4 mediated clearance after intravenous administration in children. 

The PK-Sim project file contains simulations of all published clinical studies employed during model establishment [[1-2](#reference)] and for model predictions in pediatrics [[3-4](#reference)], including the respective observed data digitized.
